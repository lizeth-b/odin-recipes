  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This recipe for hearty breakfast burritos is intended to be made in a large batch so that individual burritos can be frozen and reheated as needed. Making these in advance and freezing is a big time-saver for busy mornings!</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Cook: 24 mins</li>
    <li>Total: 54 mins</li>
    <li>Prep: 30 mins</li>
    <li>Servings: 10</li>
    <li>Yield: 10 burritos</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (12 ounce) package bacon</li>
    <li>10 large eggs</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons milk</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>4 cups frozen hash brown potatoes with peppers and onion (such as Ore-Ida® Potatoes O'Brien®)</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>10 large flour tortillas</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>1 cup salsa, or to taste</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels and crumble into bits. Keep skillet warm.</li>
    <li>Whisk eggs, milk, and salt together in a bowl. Pour into the hot skillet. Cook and stir over medium-high heat until eggs are set, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in same skillet over medium-high heat. Add frozen potatoes, garlic salt, and pepper. Fry until browned on the bottom, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and cook until other side is browned, 4 to 5 minutes more. Let cool.</li>
    <li>Cut 10 squares of aluminum foil slightly larger than the tortillas. Lay 1 tortilla on each square; evenly distribute Cheddar cheese on top. Add eggs, bacon, salsa, and potatoes to each tortilla, in that order. Tightly roll the burritos, tucking tops and bottoms in first.</li>
    <li>Wrap aluminum foil tightly around each burrito, covering it completely. Place in resealable plastic bags in a single layer. Remove as much air as possible from the bags before sealing. Store in the freezer until ready to reheat.</li>
    <li>Reheat by removing the aluminum foil, placing the burrito on a microwave-safe plate, and topping it with a paper towel. Heat in the microwave until evenly warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
  </ol>
